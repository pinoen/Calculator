# Calculator
Calculator as part of The Odin Project curricula.
This project is going to combine everything I’ve learned so far: I’am going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
My calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators.
